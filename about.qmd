# Hi, I'm Makhdoom Zaheer Ahmed 👋

I'm a passionate and aspiring data scientist with a knack for turning data into meaningful stories and actionable insights. I love the entire data science process—from cleaning and exploring raw data to building machine learning models and presenting findings in a clear, compelling way.

This project is a showcase of my skills in Python, machine learning, and data visualization. I believe that the best data science projects are not just technically sound but also solve real-world problems and communicate their value effectively.
