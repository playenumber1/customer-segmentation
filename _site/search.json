    "text": "NoteThe Business Goal\n\n\n\nA shopping mall wants to understand its customers better to improve marketing and increase sales. The objective is to identify distinct customer segments based on their demographic information and spending behavior.\n\n\nThis project demonstrates a complete data science workflow—from data cleaning and exploration to machine learning modeling and visualization—to deliver actionable business insights.\n\n\n\nThe analysis followed a structured, four-step process to ensure robust and reliable results.\n\nData Exploration & Cleaning: Loaded and inspected the customer data to understand its structure and quality.\nFeature Engineering: Selected key features (Annual Income, Spending Score) and scaled them for optimal model performance.\nClustering with K-Means: Applied the K-Means algorithm, using the Elbow Method to determine the ideal number of customer segments.\nVisualization & Interpretation: Created a clear visual representation of the clusters and analyzed their characteristics to provide business recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis revealed five distinct customer groups. Understanding these groups allows for highly targeted marketing strategies.\n\n\n\nHigh Income, High Spending This is the most valuable group. Marketing efforts should focus on retention and loyalty programs.\n\n\n\nHigh Income, Low Spending This group has high potential. They could be targeted with premium offers and personalized recommendations to encourage spending.\n\n\n\n\nLow Income, High Spending While they spend a lot, they are at risk of financial churn. Marketing should focus on value and discounts.\n\n\n\nAverage/Low Income & Spending These are the largest segments. They respond well to sales, bulk promotions, and budget-friendly options.\n\n\n\nThe final visualization below clearly shows these five segments, with the red ‘X’ marks representing the center of each group.\n\n\n\nA scatter plot showing the five distinct customer segments identified by the K-Means algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project was built using a modern data science stack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTechnologies Used\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of the code, methodology, and intermediate results, you can explore the complete interactive analysis.\n\n👉 Go to Full Analysis Notebook"
