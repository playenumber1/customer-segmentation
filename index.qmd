# 🎯 Uncovering Customer Insights with Machine Learning

::: {.callout-note}
## The Business Goal

A shopping mall wants to understand its customers better to improve marketing and increase sales. The objective is to identify distinct customer segments based on their demographic information and spending behavior.
:::

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow—from data cleaning and exploration to machine learning modeling and visualization—to deliver actionable business insights.

---

## 📊 The Process at a Glance

The analysis followed a structured, four-step process to ensure robust and reliable results.

1.  **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Loaded and inspected the customer data to understand its structure and quality.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Selected key features (`Annual Income`, `Spending Score`) and scaled them for optimal model performance.
3.  **Clustering with K-Means:** Applied the K-Means algorithm, using the Elbow Method to determine the ideal number of customer segments.
4.  **Visualization & Interpretation:** Created a clear visual representation of the clusters and analyzed their characteristics to provide business recommendations.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Actionable Insights

The analysis revealed **five distinct customer groups**. Understanding these groups allows for highly targeted marketing strategies.


::: {g-col-6}
### 💎 **Target Customers**
*High Income, High Spending*
This is the most valuable group. Marketing efforts should focus on retention and loyalty programs.

### 🤔 **Careful Customers**
*High Income, Low Spending*
This group has high potential. They could be targeted with premium offers and personalized recommendations to encourage spending.

### ⚡ **Careless Customers**
*Low Income, High Spending*
While they spend a lot, they are at risk of financial churn. Marketing should focus on value and discounts.

### 🧘 **Sensible & Standard Customers**
*Average/Low Income & Spending*
These are the largest segments. They respond well to sales, bulk promotions, and budget-friendly options.
